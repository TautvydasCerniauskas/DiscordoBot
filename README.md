# Repo for simple discord bot

## Wanted to play a little bit with the current discord channel and add command line functionality

### Currently only takes 3 simple commands

### TODO 
* [X] Shows games played by the users
* [] Ban user/s
* [X] Show user details
* [] Give permissions
* [] Timeout user

Both above completed tasks are kinda done, just need to make things look pretty
